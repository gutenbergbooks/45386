    <h2>
      Preface
    </h2>
    <p>
      Is Joe Miller "complete?" I doubt it, maugre the pretenses of title-pages.
      An old joke is sometimes like a piece of painted glass in a kaleidoscope&mdash;every
      turn gives it a new aspect, and the new view is sometimes taken for the
      original phase. Perhaps this is true of some herein, although I am
      unconscious of that being so. If the accusation be made, try Uncle Abe
      first, for he is used to trials. As for me, I shall plead my privilege of
      telling you "the tale as it was told to me." But if these "little jokes"
      be not "sworn upon" for Miller, they shall stand for Uncle Abe&mdash;the
      writer hereof claiming only a godfathership. And others shall follow as
      fast as I glean them. To aid this purpose, let everybody who has a "good
      thing" send it to the publisher of this, and duly it will appear in the
      "complete" edition of Uncle Abe's jokes, always excepting the last, for
      the act of dying over will remind him of some little story with a <i>hic
      jacet</i> moral.

    <h2>
      An Involuntary Black Republican.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Sometime after Mr. Lincoln's well remembered passage of the rebel Rubicon
      at Baltimore, some radical Republicans, who thought they saw some signs of
      the President's backwardness in vindicating the Chicago platform, went in
      committee to the White House to beg him to carry out his principles&mdash;or
      rather to stretch them in Queen Dido's style.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know about it, gentlemen," replied Uncle Abe; "with a pretty
      strong opposition at home and a rebellion at the South, we'd best push
      republicanism rather slow. Fact is, I'm worse off than old blind Jack
      Loudermill was when he got married on a short courtship. Some one asked
      him a few days after, how he liked his new position. 'Dunno,' said he; 'I
      went it blind to start with, and ain't had a chance to feel my way to a
      conclusion yet.' So it is with me. Perhaps you can see further than I can,
      to me the future is dark and lowering; and we have now got to feel every
      step of our way forward. Making Republicans used to be hard work, and I
      don't see as I could do much at it now, unless I proselyte by giving fat
      offices to weak-kneed opponents; but that," continued Uncle Abe, with a
      sly look toward several of his old Illinois friends, "would'nt be quite
      fair to those who believe that 'to the victors belong the spoils.' Your
      idea about pushing things reminds me of the first <i>black</i> Republican
      I ever made."
    </p>
    <p>
      And the President threw his left leg over his right and subsided into that
      air of <i>abandon</i> which denotes his pregnancy of a good story.
    </p>

      "You see, gentlemen," he began, "in my boyhood days, I had a slim chance
      for schooling, and did'nt improve what I did have. Occasionally a Yankee
      would wander into Kentuck, and open a school in the log building that was
      a church and school house as well, and keep it till he got starved out or
      heard of a better location. One Fall a bald headed, sour-visaged old man
      came along and opened the school, and my people concluded I must go; as
      usual the big boys soon began to test the master, who, though he was a
      patient Jeffersonian Republican, seemed very tyrannical to us. My good
      nature singled me out soon, as the scapegoat of the school, and I got more
      than my share of the birch: at least, my back was as good as an almanac,
      for every day of the week was recorded there. But, though this record of
      past time was no pastime to me, I could stand it better than I could the
      taunts and jibes of the boys out of school.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One morning when a half dozen of us were warming before the broad logwood
      fire, I noted a big fellow (who had got me flogged the day before)
      standing on the side opposite, his back to the blaze: both hands were
      partially open, one laid in the other; some would lay it to the devil, but
      it was only the spirit of revenge which prompted me to pick up a live
      coal, covered with ashes, and drop it into his hands. For a moment he
      did'nt mind it, but it burned all the deeper; when it did burn he jumped
      and bellowed like a stuck calf.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Who made that noise?' Demanded old Whitey? the master.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I made it,' replied the big fellow, rubbing his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Why?' more angrily demanded old Whitey.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Some one put a coal of fire in my hand and burnt me,' sniffled the
      booby.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The big fellow, however, didn't know who did it. Some of the boys, who
      had a lurking pity for me, said it snapt into his hand; but the master
      'couldn't see it;' and at last it leaked out that 'Abe Lincoln done it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you see, gentlemen," said Uncle Abe, moralizing, "I got the blame of a
      long score of supposititious shortcomings by one act of my own, pretty
      much as I had to bear the sins of my whole party in the late canvass,
      because of a few sins of my own."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Abraham, come up here!' thundered the master, (By the way, gentlemen, my
      people always called me Abe&mdash;my wife still calls me plain Abe&mdash;but
      that old fellow called me <i>Abraham</i> so often and so severely that I
      early dropped all claim to a definite appellative, and chose to be
      indefinitely 'A. Lincoln.') * But to go on. I got a deserved threshing
      that time, and a reputation withal for wickedness that saved all the
      little rogues in school. At last, however, I determined to be even with
      old Whitey, somehow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It wasn't long till I worked out an idea. Just over the master's desk was
      a rude shelf, upon which he kept some books and a big-bellied bottle of
      ink, which some admirer of his Jeffersonian-Republican principles had
      presented him. I had observed that in stepping upon his desk platform, he
      never touched or moved his chair, beyond leaning back in it, which he
      always did, after taking his seat. So next day I robbed our old
      long-tailed white horse of a few hairs and braided them in a three
      stranded cord. While the master was gone out to his dinner, I put the thin
      glass ink bottle upon the edge of the shelf propped a-cant, and tied one
      end of the cord to the bottle, and the other end to the back of his chair.
      The boys sympathized with me, and were in an extacy of delight. Anon the
      master came. Without looking to the right or left, he marched sternly to
      the chair, and hence saw not the repressed titter of expectation that was
      ready to burst over the whole room. I stood just outside of the door
      expecting the result; he sat down and then leaned back. Down came the
      bottle, deluging the bald head in a shower of Stygian blackness! Yes,
      gentlemen, I fancy that was the first <i>black</i> Republican ever made in
      Kentuck, but the conversion was too sudden."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How was that?" queried Cassius M. Clay.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why," replied Uncle Abe, "he afterwards married a widow and&mdash;&mdash;twelve
      negroes."
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * When Mr. Lincoln was nominated, very many papers ran up
     the name of "Abram Lincoln."

    <h2>
      The Wrong Pig by the Ear.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I never knew a flash phrase worse used up than was one by Uncle Abe
      attending one of the neighboring Circuit Courts above Springfield. He was
      employed to aid a young County Attorney to prosecute some reputed hog
      thieves. The crime of hog stealing had become so common that the people
      were considerably excited and an example was determined on. The first
      person tried was acquitted on a pretty clear <i>alibi</i> or pretty hard
      swearing. As the fellow thus acquitted was lounging round the Court House,
      Uncle Abe was passing, and he hailed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well Mr. Lincoln, I reckon you got the wrong sow by the ear when you
      undertook to pen me up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So it seems," replied Uncle Abe, blandly, "but really you must excuse me,
      pigs are so very much alike! In fact, people up here don't all seem to
      know their own."

    <h2>
      "Wilkie, where does Old Abe Lincoln Live."
    </h2>
    <p>
      In "Clay times," as the old farmers of Sangamon still recall the period of
      Henry Clay's powerful canvass for the Presidency, Uncle Abe had a wide
      circuit practice. In travelling to the various courts, he generally drove
      a horse and vehicle that some people will still remember. The horse had
      belonged to an undertaker, and the "funeral business," together with
      years, had made him a grave and staid animal. His <i>physique</i>
      presented those angularities that characterized his master, but unlike his
      owner, he was never known to perpetrate a joke or indulge in a
      "horselaugh." The vehicle was neither buggy, nor Jersey wagon, but had
      become, by virtue of alterations and repairs, what Uncle Abe afterwards
      described the Union under the plan of free and Slave States "neither one
      thing or the other." There was in fact an "eternal fitness" in horse and
      man that was not exactly a "standing joke," but a peripatetic one.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would give all my expectation of a brigadiership for a portrait of Uncle
      Abe seated in this strange "turnout," as he "might have been seen" wending
      his meditative way across the prairies.
    </p>
    <p>
      About this time Uncle Abe was nominated for Congress in the Sangamon. Yet
      he did not forego his business, but prosecuted his legal course, as well
      as all evil-doers who chanced to fall into his hands. He had just started
      on a circuit trip, to be gone a month. Often, since Mr. Lincoln's
      nomination for Congress, had Mrs. Lincoln begged him to add a second story
      to their humble dwelling, but he pleaded poverty. But a relation of Mrs.
      Lincoln's having died in Kentucky leaving her a small legacy, she
      determined her husband should have a house worthy a candidate for
      Congress. Doubtless she felt an inward satisfaction at the thought of
      furnishing a good surprise for her husband on his return. So she at once
      bought material, set mechanics at work, and in three weeks metamorphosed
      the dwelling into what political pilgrims to Springfield in 1860 will
      remember as a neat, two-story, clay-colored residence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Abe arrived home just after dark, and drove up to what he thought to
      be Eighth street, but not seeing his house, and thinking he had made a
      mistake, he drove round on to the next street. Recognizing the houses
      there; he again drove around to Eighth, and, passing his own house,
      recognized that occupied by W&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;n, a clever tailor, who
      was standing at his own gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, is that you, Wilkie?" (said Uncle Abe patronizingly.) W&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;n,
      assured him of his own identity, "Wilkie, where does Old Abe Lincoln live
      now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said W&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;n, "The Loco's say he's so sure of his
      election that he's gone to Washington to select his seat; but Mrs. Lincoln
      lives now in that beautiful new two-story house you have just passed."
      Uncle Abe indulged in a quaint laugh, and then turned his ancient horse
      around, alighted and asked if Mrs. Lincoln lived in the house before which
      he stood. Mrs. Lincoln received him as a fond woman should receive her
      lord, and the return was the cause of much pleasant badinage in social
      circles.

    <h2>
      Too Literal Obedience.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Gen. McClellan was complaining to Uncle Abe of one of his division
      commanders, who had literally obeyed an order publicly given for the
      purpose of hood-winking the rebels through the aid of the numerous
      undetected spies known to lurk in the camp as well as the capital.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That reminds me of a little story&mdash;a little thing that happened to
      me when I was out in the Black Hawk war," said Uncle Abe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see, after we brought the Foxes to terms, they were as sweet as wild
      honey. The women especially tried to make a good thing out of the defeat
      of their braves, by selling us moccasins, deerskin breeches, &amp;c. One
      squaw in particular, made beautiful breeches, and I concluded to have a
      pair made. How she was to fit my spindles, puzzled me at first, as the
      Indians are no tailors in any <i>measurable</i> degree. At last I
      bethought me of an old pair which I had in my saddle bag, and these I gave
      to her that she might rip them open and use the parts for patterns. When
      she brought the new ones home, I was not a little angry to find that she
      had exactly imitated the old patch on the nether parts of the new
      breeches."
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Mac smiled in his peculiar grave way, and remarked that when he
      gave an order for a similar purpose, he would tell this story by way of a
      hint.

    <h2>
      How Uncle Abe Felt.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Soon after Uncle Abe's defeat by Judge Douglas in 1848, (whereby Douglas
      unwittingly made a President) some one asked Uncle Abe how he felt over
      the result.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said he, "I feel a good deal like a big boy I knew in Kentuck.
      After he'd got a terrible pounding by the school master, someone asked him
      how he felt? 'Oh! said he, it hurt so awful bad, I couldn't laugh, and I
      was too big to cry over it.' That's just my case."
    </p>
    <p>
      It is presumed the questioner got an idea how a defeated politician feels.

    <p>
      Soon after the advent of Uncle Abe at the White House, the pressure of
      aspirants for official positions was perfectly crushing.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, Uncle Abe sometimes got so flustered by their bedevilment, that
      he not only failed to recollect an illustrating anecdote, but soon lost
      his temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the Illinois applicants&mdash;a fellow named Jeff.
    </p>
    <p>
      D&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;r, was particularly a bore, seeming to think it part
      of the Chicago platform to give every village politician an office.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Seems to me, Jeff," said Uncle Abe, "you got the Chicago platform reduced
      to enormous brevity&mdash;in fact, just three p's would seem to express
      your idea of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How's that, Mr. Lincoln?" inquired-Jeff.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, it looks to me as if it was patriotism, place and plunder, and a
      mighty important plea is the last one, I reckon."

      Jeff was silent for a while, but bored on until he "struck ile" in the

      Rattaned for a Rat Joke.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Just after the retreat of the rebels from Bull Run, when it leaked out
      that our troops had been held at bay by wooden or Quaker guns, a
      Pennsylvanian Congressman remarked to Uncle Abe&mdash;"Well, Mr. Lincoln,
      you see that Quaker principles even embodied in wood may be of some
      service in war."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but as you see in that shape, they are only substituted principles;
      such things may do once, but found out, they will avail worse than
      nothing. Your remark, however, 'reminds me of a little story.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "When I was a youngster of fifteen or so, I went to an 'Academy' for a few
      weeks, just to brush up my old-field school learning. Such schools are
      called Academies in the East, to distinguish their intermediate position
      between colleges and common schools; but in Kentuck and the West,
      generally the high sounding title merely meant that the 'principal' taught
      a few branches ahead of the old-field schools. Well, the rats were thick
      about the old building where we daily gathered to reap the fruit of
      knowledge; and as many of the boys brought their dinners and threw the
      fragments under their old-fashioned box desks, they soon grew as bold as
      they were thick. The teacher had a mortal antipathy to rats, and as I
      didn't 'take' to the teacher, I naturally encouraged the rats. Whenever
      one showed himself, he was sure to get a whack from the old teacher's
      rattan. Sometimes he missed his aim at the rats, but never at us boys,
      which was owing, perhaps, to the difference in the size of the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      "An industrious rat had made a hole from beneath the floor up under my
      desk, and thence out through the end, and as I fed him well he was quite
      tame. Often during school hours he would come up and peer out into the
      aisles through his hole in the end of the desk, and whenever he was seen
      by the teacher, he was sure to see the rattan whirling in the air. An idea
      struck me one day. I got a dead rat&mdash;I did not like to kill my pet&mdash;and
      stuffing it, made quite a good-looking 'Quaker' rat. Then I fixed some
      springs so I could work my rat out and in at pleasure; so whenever the
      teacher was looking up, my rat was always out; but when the whack came
      down, he was in betimes. At last he seemed to think it wondrous tame, and
      the ill-suppressed titter of the school boys finally made him suspicious.
      The boys had been let into my secret, and relished it hugely, and I was
      too prone to give a few exhibitions. At last the teacher watched me
      sharper than he did the rat, and then caught me in the act. He got hold of
      the rat and beat me alternately with rat and switch, and you may well
      guess, I was well rattaned. If soldiers who use wooden guns ever get worse
      usage, I pity them."
    </p>
    <p>
      The 300 Pounder Parrot since used by the Government, shows Uncle Abe's
      poor appreciation of Quaker guns and Quaker principles.

    <h2>
      A Judge of the Post Office.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Judge David Davis of Bloomington, Illinois, who was recently appointed (by
      Uncle Abe) to a position on the bench of the Supreme Court of the United
      States, is known to many of his friends as one of the best hearted men in
      the world. His, is withal, full of the piety of good humor. I call it
      "piety," because I think a smiling face is a perpetual thanksgiving to
      God. His benevolence, however, edges down his wit, and gives it more the
      characteristic of humor, strictly speaking. This, while it may have helped
      that "belly with fat capon lined," has kept him at peace with himself and
      the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      On one occasion, while Judge Davis was presiding at the Logan County
      Circuit Court, a case came up that involved a question of postal law.
      Uncle Abe was on the case, and politely loaned Judge D. a small manual of
      postal law, that he might see for himself what the letter of the law was.
      The Judge gave his understanding of the law, but had hardly finished when
      Mr. S&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;s, a burley farmer from Clear Creek, jumped up
      and sang out&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I reckon that ain't so, Judge. I've been Post-Master more'n a dozen
      years, and I reckon I ought to know what's Post Office law."
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course Judge Davis had every right to fine the man for contempt, but he
      had a different way of treating such cases. "With a tone in which sarcasm
      only slightly blended, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Truly, I think you ought, Mr. S&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;s. It has never been
      my privilege to be a Post-Master, and I would like your opinion in this
      case. Please step this way."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Judge moved over and made room on the bench, which Mr. S&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;s
      occupied, and proceeded to give <i>his</i> opinion on the mooted question.
      The bar sat smiling in expectation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Keep your seat, Mr. S&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;s, while I speak a word with my
      friend Parks."
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Abe it was who had been interrupted, so he resumed:
    </p>
    <p>
      "May it please the Court, I had some doubt on this point myself, so I
      borrowed the usual manual of Postal Law, to be perfectly assured. I regret
      to contend that the clear letter of the law conflicts&mdash;sadly

      One day while Uncle Abe was attending to a case at Mount Pulaski, (the
      country seat of Logan County, Illinois,) he was beset by old B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;s,
      a worthy farmer, but a notorious malaprop, for an opinion as to his
      amenability to the road tax. "You look here, Mr. Lincoln, these fellows
      here want to make me work on the road."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well!" said Uncle Abe.

      "On another occasion, he wanted John G. Gillette, the great cattle dealer,

      How Uncle Abe got his Sobriquet.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Some one ventured to ask Uncle Abe, soon after his arrival at the White
      House, how he got the sobriquet of "Honest Abe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh," said he, "I suppose my case was pretty much like that of a country
      merchant I once read of. Some one called him a 'little rascal.' 'Thank you
      for the compliment,' said he. 'Why so?' asked the stigmatizer. 'Because
      that title distinguishes me from my fellow tradesmen, who are all <i>great</i>
      rascals.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So honest lawyers were so scarce in Illinois that you were thus
      distinguished from them?" persisted the questioner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," quoth Uncle Abe, glancing slyly at Douglas, Sweet, and others from
      Illinois, "it's hard to say where the honest ones are."

    <h2>
      "I'll take Number Eleven too."
    </h2>
    <p>
      Thirty-five or forty years ago, a trip from Sangamon or Macon County, to
      St. Louis, was an event to be talked of. It took as long to make it, and
      furnished food for as much rustic enquiry and comment, as does a voyage to
      Europe now. Uncle Abe had then given up rail-splitting, and was studying
      law. Having a little while before treated himself to a (then) rare thing,
      a suit of "store clothes;" and a neighbor being about to leave for St.
      Louis, he resolved to go along. As the teams toiled on at the rate of
      fifteen or twenty miles a day, they were gradually joined by others, till
      the train presented somewhat the sights now to be seen on our great
      overland routes to the Pacific.
    </p>
    <p>
      On arrival at St. Louis, Abe determined to see high life, and accordingly
      made tracks for a letter A. No. 1, first class Hotel. The Old City Hotel
      was then the only house that could claim that distinction. There the
      merchants congregated, and there the Indian trader sought relaxation from
      frontier hardships, while the rough trapper was content with the humble
      fare of the "Hunter's Home."
    </p>
    <p>
      I forget what association called out this reminiscence of that trip; but
      there can be no harm in repeating the story. Such mishaps have befallen
      incipient greatness before.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the dinner table, each waiter was provided with a wine card, and each
      guest had his wine charged to the number of his room, simply calling out,
      as for instance, Sherry No. 9, &amp;c. A jolly Indian trader, sat just
      opposite Abe, who betimes called "Claret, No 11." Abe saw that most of the
      guests were similarly providing for themselves, and concluded not to
      appear penurious, so he said he'd take some wine too.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What kind, sah?" asked the waiter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I'll take the same,"&mdash;pointing to the bottle just called for by
      the Indian trader.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What number, sah?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Abe was puzzled. Ho had not been used to wine or hotel life; but it was
      only a moment before he broke the ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I'll just take No. 11 too."
    </p>
    <p>
      The trader looked up surprised, while several others near by, smiled a
      faint comprehension as to the state of affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, young man," said the trader, "that is my number, and mine is a
      single room."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg pardon," stammered Abe, conscious that he had betrayed rusticity
      and ignorance; but not knowing exactly how to extricate himself, the
      good-hearted trader came to his aid&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Were you ever in the city before?" asked he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never before."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, in memory of your advent, it shall be No. 11 too," and he
      quietly pushed the bottle across the table. So agreeable was he that Abe
      rallied, and the second bottle followed the fate of the first. On renewing
      the conversation after dinner, the trader was satisfied that Abe had
      'lots' of 'horse sense,' but little of worldly experience, and he
      friendlily invited him to go out with him as a clerk; but, Abe declined.
      Had he gone&mdash;what? Perhaps he might have become a respectable Indian
      trader&mdash;perhaps he never had been elected President, and perhaps we
      would have had no rebellion.

    <h2>
      A Severe Retort.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Uncle Abe took a great liking to the late Col. Ellsworth, and afterwards
      did him the honor of making a Colonel of him. The rebel Jackson did the
      rest, but enough of that. Many of our readers will recall the slim, spruce
      figure of Col. Ellsworth as he paraded the streets of Springfield, dressed
      in a unique Zouave uniform, a mere boy in appearance. He was full of
      animal spirits. He and Bob O'Lincoln were cutting up didoes in the Law
      office of Lincoln and Hornden, which greatly annoyed Uncle Abe, and he
      gently reproved them. Bob, a little nettled, replied by quoting the common
      couplet:
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      "A little nonsense now and then,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Is relished by the wisest men."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Uncle Abe, looking severely at Bob, "that's the difference
      between a wise man and a fool who relishes it all the time."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bob subsided, and Ellsworth betook himself anew to Blackstone.

    <h2>
      Had all the Time there Was.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Uncle Abe used to attend the Courts in the regions round about
      Sangamon, he generally made easy stays, and was wont to look at the
      country and talk to the people at his leisure. On one occasion he was
      riding by the premises of old H&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, who was notorious
      for his unthriftiness, and who was in the act of driving some stray hogs
      out of his corn-field.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good morning, Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;," said Uncle Abe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Morning, Mr. Lincoln, morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why don't you mend that piece of fence thoroughly, Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
      and keep the pigs out?" asked Uncle Abe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha'n't got time," said H&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why," said Uncle Abe, with an air of blended reproof and humor, "you've
      got all the time there is Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;."
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether H&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; mended his fence and his thriftless habits,
      this deponent knoweth not; but has often thought how true was the remark,
      whether as a joke or an admonition. Every second, minute or hour is ours&mdash;ours
      to use or ours to squander. How wontonly wasteful would be the rich man
      who should stand upon a vessel's deck and cast his million golden coins
      into the sea; yet day after day we stand upon the shores of eternity, and
      cast the golden moments into the unreturning past. All the knowledge and
      wealth of the world is but the result of improved time. So don't say you
      "havn't got time," for you've got all there is, as Uncle Abe says.

    <h2>
      Could Stand it a Day or Two,
    </h2>
    <p>
      About the time this occurred, there stood on one side of Capitol Square,
      in Springfield, a Hotel, now doubtless out of memory of most of the
      occupants of the out-lots and additions which speculators have hitched to
      the original village. In its day it was a "first-class hotel," but it
      waned before the "American" and is now among the "things that were." There
      were some who doubted the cleanliness of the <i>cuisine</i>, and "thereby
      hangs a tale."
    </p>
    <p>
      Judge Brown arrived in town and put up at the aforesaid hotel, whereat,
      Uncle Abe, on meeting him, expressed his regret, begging him to become <i>his</i>
      guest. The Judge would fain not trouble his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you know the reputation of the place&mdash;the kitchen?" said Uncle
      Abe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've heard of it," said the Judge; "but as I want to keep my appetite, I
      always shun the kitchen, if not the cooks."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But surely, can't you see by the table alone, Judge?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know, Mr. Lincoln, but I'm going to stop only a day or two, and I guess
      I can stand for that time what the landlord's family stand all their
      lives."
    </p>
    <p>
      Speaking of Hotels, reminds me of a little episode of one of Uncle Abe's
      professional visits to Cairo, in Egypt, a town fenced in with mud-banks
      and celebrated for its mud-holes and mean whisky. Thereabouts is a Hotel,
      and thereat Uncle Abe stopped because the water forbade further traveling.
      When his bill was presented to him next morning, he ventured to remark,
      "that his accommodation had not been of the most agreeable kind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are very much crowded," apologetically replied the landlord.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I had hard work to get breakfast this morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," continued the apologist, "we are greatly in need of help."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well," said Uncle Abe, "you keep a first rate hotel in one
      respect."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" said the landlord, brightening up, "in what respect is that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your bills," said Undo Abe, vanishing towards the "Central" cars.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Ky-ro-ite landlord perhaps thought he ought to be well compensated for
      keeping a hotel in such a place. A man of his sort used to "keep tavern"
      in Pasy County, Indiana, several years ago. A pedestrian stopped with him
      over night, for which the charge was 2.50.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, landlord," said he, "this is an outrageous bill."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean it's a big'un?" said the insatiate Boniface.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, stranger, we keep tavern here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What has that to do with such a bill?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look at that'ere sign, stranger&mdash;cost ten dollars; your'n the fust
      trav'ler that's bin along for three weeks, and we can't afford to keep
      tavern for nothin&mdash;<i>we</i> can't!"

    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Uncle Abe, "we've got too many old officers in the army, and
      that is not the worst of it&mdash;<i>we've got two many old women</i>
      there!" This was when Uncle Abe's faith was strong in little Mac.
    </p>

      say that Rome was not built in a day, does not prove that it was built in

      Accoutred en Militaire.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the outset of the famous Black-hawk war in Illinois, a "hoss company"
      was raised in the region where Uncle Abe was (then) a rising lawyer. I say
      rising, although he had then reached a height sufficient to help himself
      to most blessings&mdash;and he, the aforesaid U.A., was chosen Captain.
      Uncle Abe rode a "slapping stallion," who was either naturally restive, or
      appreciated his new honor too highly&mdash;at any rate, he corvetted and
      pirouetted like a very Bucephalus. At last he unhorsed his rider, who
      landed sprawling on the prairie in one of those green excrescences that
      abound where bovine herds range. As the discomfitted Uncle Abe rose, and
      surveyed his predicament, old Pierre Menard, who was a near spectator,
      remarked in his broken French:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vell, I nevair sees any man accoutred en militaire like zat before."
    </p>
    <p>
      Most old suckers pronounce accoutred as the Yankees do the word cowcumber,
      and this rendered Menard's joke more unctious.

      Perils of Illinois Lawyers.

    <p>
      Years ago, when the capital of Suckerdom was a village of less
      "magnificence" than it now presents&mdash;when Lincoln, Harden, Baker,
      McDougal, Douglas, Shields and Ferguson were all village lawyers, and
      scarcely known to fame&mdash;Judge Thomas Brown was on the Supreme bench
      of the State. He was to some extent a "character;" but not a very
      successful lawyer. He went to California, since when he has been generally
      lost sight of; but his old friends may be assured that if he is in the
      "land of the living," Uncle Abe's tax collectors will find him. But that's
      neither here nor there. His ideas of the perils of practicing law in
      Illinois, in early times, is what is now before the reader.
    </p>
    <p>
      On one occasion, after he had changed his residence to Peoria, having some
      business to transact in Springfield, he arrived in that place and put up
      at the old American House, (now kept by Henry Bidgely, Esq.) He chanced to

      intemperance.

    </p>
    <p>
      "I've heard that, too," said Uncle Abe, "but I think they will do pretty
      well <i>if I can keep them out of Washington!</i>"

    <p>
      The Committee didn't carry their measure, by a jug full.

      When the Illinois boys gathered at Springfield, under the call of the ten
      regiment bill, they were quartered on the fair grounds, just out of the
      city. All the stalls were filled with troops, before which were signs as
      "St. Nicholas," "Richmond House," etc., etc. Charley W&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
      on going through the fair grounds, looked into the "Richmond House," and

      Little Mac Helped by an Illustration.

    <p>
      "I can't seem to reap any advantage from the rebel movements," said
      McClellan, in consultation with Uncle Abe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you just keep a watchful, careful eye on Leer and perhaps you will
      yet see how to make use of them, as old Mother Grundy did of her crooked
      wood."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thereby hangs a tale," remarked little Mac, with one of his peculiar,
      quaint smiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're right, General. Your remark reminded me of a good old neighbor of
      my father's, in Kentucky, who died many years ago. She was sweet-tempered&mdash;few
      such in this world." Uncle Abe stopped as though a mental comparison had
      damaged some woman of his acquaintance. "Yes, her disposition was of that
      kind that extracts 'good from things evil.' And she was her husband's
      pride and boast. One day he was praising her to a neighbor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Look here, old man Grundy,' said the neighbor 'these women are just like
      cats&mdash;they are all right as long as you stroke the fur the right way,
      but reverse the movement, and you'll see the fire fly. Now, I'll tell you
      what, I bet a four-gallon keg of my four-year-old peach, that I can tell
      you how to make her as mad as a set-hen, if you dare to try."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Done,' cried old man Grundy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Well, you just haul home all the crookedest sticks of wood you can find,
      and then see.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Old man Grundy brought home a small load every day or two, and it was
      knotty and crooked as a pigs-tail; but not a word or look of complaint.
      For a week this continued, with the same result, when he asked the good
      wife how she liked the wood."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Oh,'tis beautiful wood,' said she; 'it burns finely, and then it fits <i>around
      my pots and kettles just, as if 'twas made on purpose</i>.'"

      Lee did not fit into Mac's hand so well, yet the story was not without its

      An Acre of Fight.
    </h2>
    <p>
      During the progress of the Senatorial campaign between Douglas and
      Lincoln, Uncle Abe came home to recreate a few days. Douglas, long used to
      the political arena, bore the fatigues of the canvass like a veteran. His
      custom was to bathe just after supper, getting some friend to rub him like
      a race horse, when he would sit down and enjoy his whisky and cigar.
      Lincoln, lank and abstemious, bore his yoke with evident weariness. But to
      the story.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Abe went up into the Governor's room in the State House, where he
      was soon joined by many of the leading Republicans of the town. Some one
      remarked on his look of weariness. "It is a mighty contest," remarked
      Uncle Jesse Du Bois.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But Mr. Lincoln does not show his great appreciation of it upon the
      stand," remarked a Chicago correspondent, in allusion to Uncle Abe's good
      humored replies to Douglas.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But still, when the day's gladiatorial combat is over, it seems to me, as
      the Kentucky fellow said, that I had been through 'an acre of fight.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give us that story, Abe," said Dr. Wallace, Uncle Abe's brother-in-law.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, one of my earliest recollections of a Kentucky Court, was a trial
      about a fight. It took place in the Court House grounds, and the Judge,
      thinking it constructable as a contempt of Court, sent out the Sheriff,
      and had the parties quickly brought before him. Both had bruised noses and
      beavers, and showed the unmistakable evidence of having been in a
      scrimage. The witnesses were numerous, and the evidence was so
      conflicting, that the Judge declared he could legally reach no other
      conclusion than that there had <i>been no fight at all</i>. But the
      Sheriff ventured to suggest:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here's Jim Blowers&mdash;he had hold on one of them fellers, when I
      arrested them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Clerk," said the Judge, "you will at once swear Mr. Blowers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, Mr. Blowers," said the Clerk, "you will please tell the Court what
      you know about this affair."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, ax on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, was there a fight between these parties?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just a bit of scrimage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was a real fight, was it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, some people would call it that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How much of a fight was it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, considerable&mdash;they pulled and hauled about kinder like two cows
      when they lock horns."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, tell the Court more precisely?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I should say it was a right smart fight."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But <i>how</i> much of a fight?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, just about an acre, I reckon."
    </p>
    <p>
      It is needless to say that the crowd enjoyed the joke hugely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is easier to pay a small debt than a larger one."

    <h2>
      Uncle Abe Believes in the Intelligence of Oysters.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the year 1860 or thereabouts, when a great patent case was being tried
      in Chicago, and champagne and oysters were the favorite viands served
      nightly to Counsel and Jurors after the adjournment of Court, it happened
      that one Ed. D&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;n, a young patent lawyer from New York,
      was present on one of those occasions. Now, Ned is terribly afflicted with
      a determination of words to the mouth, and managed to monopolize the whole
      conversation. Ned had a speech to make upon everything, and kept buzzing
      around like a musquito, dipping his bill into everything animate or
      inanimate, no matter which. At last he began to officiate at serving out
      the oysters, and with ladle in hand, said in his usual stilted style, "I
      wonder whether this bivalve, this seemingly obtuse oyster, is endowed with
      any degree of intelligence." Uncle Abe looked at the puppy, who, by the
      way, had prevented him cracking a single one of his favorite jokes for the
      entire evening, and quaintly remarked, that "he was satisfied that an
      oyster knew when to shut up, and that was more than some New York lawyers
      knew." Ned has never propounded the query as to the intellect of oysters
      since.

    <h2>
      An Egyptian Snake Story
    </h2>
    <p>
      The last county made in Illinois&mdash;I don't mean by the Legislature,
      but by Nature, and where dirt was so short that it lies under water part
      of the year&mdash;is called Alexander, and used to boast two rival towns,
      both thoroughly Egyptian in their nomenclative association&mdash;Cairo and
      Thebes. Twenty years ago Thebes was the "seat of justice;" but Cairo was
      then beginning to entertain magnificent expectations, and her citizens
      wanted to have the Court House removed to their town. The contest waxed
      warm. The Thebans contended that Cairo was only a "daub of mud on the tail
      of the State," while Thebes was destined to hold the same relation to
      Alexander, that its ancient namesake did to Egypt in the time of Menes.
      [See Herodotus.] But to settle the dispute, the Legislature must be
      appealed to, and that involved the choice of a man favorable to the
      change. This narrowed the fight right down to a hot county canvass between
      the Theban and Cairoine interests.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Cairo man conceived a scheme that was ahead of anything yet achieved by
      Uncle Abe's brigadiers in the way of "strategy." He wrapped a boulder in a
      green hide, making a perfectly round mass, to which he attached a mule;
      then night after night he drew the stone through sand and mud. By going on
      a straight line, the mule's tracks were concealed, and the track left,
      resembled that made by a huge serpent.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>

    <h5>
      <a href="images/0041.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      These tracks were mainly in the south end of the county, and caused an
      excitement that almost absorbed the election interest. Soon it was
      reported that Mrs. so and so had seen a huge snake. The wonder grew apace.
      Anon it was currently reported that two men had seen the great serpent
      five miles above Cairo. The excitement increased. Several daring hunters
      followed the track, of which new ones were made every night; but the trail
      always led into water and was lost. Several persons missed hogs and
      calves, which were surmised to have gone into the capacious maw of the
      serpent. Finally word was given out that a great hunt was to come off in
      the lower part of the county, and the rendezvous was appointed. On the
      morning, hundreds were there from all parts of the county, and dividing
      into squads they started to scour the country about. At night they
      returned from their snakeless hunt, but so anxious were the people to get
      rid of his snakeship, that they furnished an abundance of edibles and
      whisky. All were in hilarious spirits, determined to renew the hunt on the
      following morning. By daylight the hunters were again on the tramp, and
      men from the lower part of the county happened to fall into the squad.
    </p>
    <p>
      About 3 o'clock in the afternoon, a squad of the bans hove in sight of a
      small village, <i>i.e.</i> one house a blacksmith shop and a grocery,
      where, seeing a large crowd assembled, they hurried up in expectation of
      seeing the dead monster. <i>But the men were voting!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thunder!" cried a Theban, "this is election day, and I'll bet my bottom
      dollar we're sold!"
    </p>
    <p>
      They started for the rendezvous and spread their suspicions; but so few
      reached their own precincts, that the Cairo man was elected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the joke came out; but the Thebans couldn't see the "laughing place;"
      their rage and mortification was so intense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Abe was a member of the Legislature, when an effort was made to
      change the county seat of Alexander; and though he liked the joke hugely
      by which the Thebans had been "diddled," he saw the honesty of the thing
      and so voted against any change.

    <h2>
      Why Uncle Abe Made a Brigadier.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When the rebellion had gone so far as to give the most hopeful some clear
      idea of its extent and malignancy, it chanced that J. A. Mc&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;d,
      a leading politician of Illinois, made a visit to Washington, and imitated
      his friend Douglas so far as to call upon Uncle Abe. The "shoot" that
      certain prominent Democrats gave indication of taking, by talking of
      reconstruction and a Northwestern Republic, gave the new administration
      some concern. Uncle Abe was very sociable with Logan, Mac, and a few of
      their "ilk." So Uncle Abe not only extended to Mac the hospitalities of
      the White House, but accompanied him on a visit to the arsenal. While
      there, their attention was drawn to some muskets which the speculators had
      furnished to Cameron, and which were thought (generally) very dangerous to
      those who used them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mac caught up one, and sighted along the barrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do that again, Mac," said Uncle Abe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mac complied. Uncle Abe was evidently struck with an idea, and Mac was
      anxious to know what it was like.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Mac," said Uncle Abe, "I was thinking if we could get all our
      soldiers to make up that kind of a face, that the rebels couldn't stand it
      a moment." Mac didn't relish Uncle Abe's joke, as he was hopefully in
      pursuit of the third wife; but he put the best face he could upon the
      matter, and remarked to Uncle Abe&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps you'd better make me a Brigadier then!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And why not?" asked Uncle Abe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mac got his commission.

    </h2>
    <p>
      Uncle Abe was met one day near Springfield, by a conceited coxcomb, who
      had built him a house at some distance, and invited him to dinner. Uncle
      Abe did not much relish the Jackenape's acquaintance. In fact, as Justice
      Shallow has it, had "written him down an Ass." However, Abe enquired very
      minutely, where Snooks lived? "Thistle Grove," replied the verdant Snooks;
      "but there's no grove now, and not a single thistle!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh, what!" cries Uncle Abe, "not a single thistle! Then what on airth do
      you live on?"

    </div>
    <h2>
      Uncle Abe Divided on a Question.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In 1840 or '41, Uncle Abo was a member of the Illinois Legislature. The
      Capital had lately been removed from Vandalia to Springfield. The
      Legislature met in the Presbyterian church.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have forgotten what measure was before the house; but it was one in
      which there were many members who did not wish to commit themselves. Uncle
      Abe was in this predicament. He sat near an open window, and when the
      clerk, calling the ayes and nays had got down to L's, Uncle Abe thrust his
      right leg out of the window, and was just drawing its long companion after
      it, when an anti-dodging member "seeing the game," shut the sash down and
      held Uncle Abe in a trap.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lincoln," called out the Clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Speaker," said Col. Thornton, "Mr. Lincoln is <i>divided</i> on this
      question, and I move you that the sergeant at arms be sent to bring in
      that part of him that is out of the window."
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Abe was "<i>brought in</i>" amid a universal titter, to his evident
      mortification.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1840, the Union generally went for Harrison; but Illinois,
      particularly, was democratic. When the Legislature met in the Fall of that
      year, the Whig members tried to break up the <i>new</i> Session by
      absenting themselves from voting to adjourn the old Session <i>sine die</i>,
      so that they could Constitutionally meet the next Wednesday morning; the
      State Constitution requiring the Legislature to meet "the first Monday in
      December next, ensuing the election of members." After the breaking up of
      the morning Session, the Sergeant-at-arms hunted up the delinquent Whigs,
      and at 3 o'clock there was a quorum obtained, and the doors locked. The
      Springfield <i>Register</i> of Dec. 11, 1840, mentions this matter, but
      thinks Uncle Abe "come off without damage, as it was noticed that his legs
      reached nearly from the window to the ground!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A proposition was afterwards humorously proposed, to add another story to
      the new State House, so that fugacious members would have to go down the
      water spouts if they ran!

      Tried for Scaring the Girls.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Thirty years ago, when Springfield was blooming into the dignity of its
      Capitalive position, the American House was its great hotel, (and it isn't
      its smallest yet,) and the resort of those who loved to spend a few hours
      in the society of the <i>bon vivants</i> who then assembled&mdash;Lincoln,
      Douglas, Shields, Ferguson, Herndon, (then a young man, but since the law
      partner of Uncle Abe,) and many others "not unknown to fame," could almost
      always be found here during the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening as they were sitting in free converse in the bar-room, one of
      the chamber maids came in and informed the landlord that a man was under
      her bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems while stooping down to untie her gaiters, she saw a man under the
      bed. With rare presence of mind, she excused herself to her fellow servant
      as having forgotten some duty, and reported her discovery to the landlord.
      Boniface at once called for volunteers to secure the interloper. So eager
      were they for fun, that all volunteered. They surprised and captured the
      man, and brought him down to the bar-room; but what to do with him? was
      the next question. Springfield then had no vagabonds who made fees out of
      misfortunes&mdash;i.e. policemen&mdash;and it was determined to treat him
      with the prompt justice peculiar to that era. A court was therefore got
      together at once, all expectant of fun but the unfortunate culprit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Judge Thomas Brown was decided upon to act as Judge; Melborn, the
      talented, but eccentric State Attorney, was detailed to prosecute; and
      Lincoln and Douglas to defend the prisoner. Dr. Wallace acted as Sheriff,
      and upon the jury were Dr. Merriman, * Gen. Shields, John Calhoun (of
      Lecompton memory,) Uri Manly, and many other well known personages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lawborn, though a regularly-educated and talented lawyer, took occasion
      not only to be as "funny as he could," but to imitate the prevailing style
      of oratory too common in Illinois&mdash;a style in which the

      back-woodsman.

    <p>
      "<i>May it please your Honor, and you, gentlemen of the Jury</i>: The
      Legislature of Illinois, though it has legislated upon every subject it
      could think of, has omitted to pass any act against a man being born as
      ugly as he pleases. If such an idea ever occurred to my friend Lincoln
      here, when in the Legislature, I know he would at once dismiss it, not
      only as too personal, but as repugnant to his honest heart. As for myself,
      I like ugly men. An ugly man stands up on his own merits. Nature has done
      nothing for him, and he feels that he must labor to supply the deficit by
      amiability and good conduct generally. There is not an ugly man in this
      room but has felt this. A pretty man, on the contrary, trusts his face to
      supply head, heart and everything. He is an anomaly in nature, as though
      the productions had been at fault as to sex, and sought to correct it when
      too late. They are girl's first loves, and doting husband's jealous bane.
      I confess I don't like pretty men half so well as I do pretty women.

      "No, gentlemen, ugliness is nothing. It is manners that is everything. The
      ugliest man that ever lived, never intentionally frightened a woman&mdash;nay,
      never was so unfortunate as to do so. But this creature, gentlemen of the
      Jury, this mendacious wretch whom you set in judgment upon&mdash;this
      creature, who would doubtless enter for a prize of beauty at a vanity fair&mdash;how
      has he failed in his duty to society? Why, gentlemen, by crawling under
      the bed upon which two fair damsels were about to expose their loveliness
      to Diana's envious gaze. Did he wish to woo them? Petruche's was rough in
      his wooing&mdash;this man was mean! Woman loves not surprises. Their
      hearts are fond of open sieges. This is the case of all women-kind. Maugre

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a <i>mystery</i> that adds to beauty, and the woman who surrenders
      that to importunity or surprise, has lost half her vantage ground. The
      story of Guyges and Candaules' queen, if not paralleled here, is not
      without its moral. What else meant this wretch, gentlemen of the Jury, but
      to surprise these charming damsels when only armed with the light shield
      that the Huntress and the cotton plant throws over earthly beauty? Or,
      perhaps he meant more&mdash;his own guilty heart can only accuse him
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gentlemen of the Jury, the failure of our Legislature to provide a
      specific punishment for such miscreants, as this&mdash;lecherous
      creatures, who steal upon woman amid the mysteries of the bed-room&mdash;is
      no reason why society should fold its arms and leave woman's hidden
      beauties to be anatomized by guilty eyes. No, gentlemen of the Jury,
      outraged decency cries for its victim, and here he tremblingly, guiltily
      stands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gentlemen of the Jury, where are the spirits of the fathers of the
      Constitution? Are they not hovering over us in the air of the still summer
      day? Are they not wailing upon the winds that sweep over our prairies? Are
      they not heard in the sigh of the mountain pine? Are they not abroad in
      all lands, whispering to earth's downtrodden millions like a voice of
      hope? Yes, gentlemen of the Jury! and where was this creature then? Why,
      creeping under the bed of two girls, hazzarding the chance of overturning&mdash;well,
      it matters not."

      &mdash;And much more, in a view that needed to be heard to be appreciated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lincoln followed, illustrating with anecdotes meet for the place and
      occasion, of which I recollect only the opening. "Gentlemen of the Jury,"
      said he, "the remarks of my friend Lawborn about ugly men, comes home to
      my bosom like the sweet oders of a rose to its neighboring great sister,
      the cabbage. It was a grateful, a just tribute to that neglected class of
      the community&mdash;ugly men, I wish to say something for my client,
      although it must in candor be admitted, that he had 'gone to pot.' I don't
      see why we should throw the kettle after him; he may be the victim of
      circumstances; he looks very bashful now, and it may be the girls scared
      him; who knows? At least I claim for him the benefit of a doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, gentlemen, many of us have, or might have suffered from a
      concatenation of circumstances as strong as that under which my client
      labors. Let me relate a little personal anecdote in illustration. When I
      was making the secret canvass of this country, with my friend Cartwright,
      the Pioneer Preacher, we chanced to stop at the house of one of our old
      Kentucky farmers, whose log-cabin parlor, kitchen and hall were blended in
      one, and only separated at night by sundry blankets hung up between the
      beds. As we were candidates for the august Legislature of Illinois, our
      host treated us with the privacy of a blanket room. During the night I was
      awakened by some one throwing their leg over me with some force. I thought
      it was neighbor Cartright, and took hold of it to give it a toss back; but
      it didn't feel like one of his white oak legs, and while I was feeling it
      to ascertain the correctness of my half-awake doubts, a stifled scream
      thoroughly awakened me, and the leg was withdrawn. Why, gentlemen, would
      you believe me? It was the leg of our host's daughter! Imagine my position
      if you can! What an <i>apparent</i> breach of hospitality! While I was
      imagining an excuse for my conduct, the 'old folks' struck a light, and
      the blanket between our bed and that of the buxom damsel, was discovered
      to have been pulled down! More damning proof, thought I. I feigned sleep,
      but kept one corner of my left eye open for observation. The blanket was
      soon fixed up, and I was greatly relieved to hear the damsel explain to
      her mother that she herself had invaded our bed while dreaming, caused by
      some un-digestable vegetables she had eaten for her supper. Our host was
      serene and affable in the morning, and I had no need to apologize; but,
      gentlemen, imagine what an escape I had, and have mercy on my client."

      "Thank God for the Sassengers."
    </h2>
    <p>
      Most of the readers of this have perhaps read a good story of Oliver
      Ditson, the celebrated Boston Music publisher. After he had been in
      business several years, his New Hampshire friends invited him to open his
      Thanksgiving in his native town, he accepted the invitation and started
      with some of his friends. On the way Ditson was the great man of the
      occasion, and was therefore placed at the head of the table, when it
      devolved upon him to ask the blessing. Now Oliver practiced more religion
      than he knew the exact forms for, and he was in a sad dilemma; but he
      essayed boldly the task. He thanked God for all the 'creature comforts'
      there were upon the table&mdash;for all there ever had been&mdash;for all
      that was expected. But how to quit? He went on, thanking and trying to
      think at the same time how 'blessings' ended, but to no purpose. Knives
      rattled, plates moved, and Oliver saw the hungry people were getting
      impatient, and he came to the end in a real business like style, with&mdash;"Yours,
      respectfully, OLIVER DITSON."

    <p>
      Almost as good an anecdote is told by Uncle Abe of one of his old friends,
      a Mr. Sawyer, who merchandized either in Macon or Champaign County.
      Sawyer, was a Yankee, and distinguished for little besides an immoderate
      liking for "sassingers," as he called that "linked sweetness" which polite
      people call sausages. When Uncle Abe was stumping the Sangamon District
      for Congress, it befell that he and Sawyer met at the same country hotel,
      which was kept by a hardshell Baptist, whose foible was long prayers and
      blessings at table. They&mdash;Lincoln and Sawyer&mdash;happened to be
      going to the same town by the same coaches. So they were up betimes and
      ready, but breakfast was delayed. They at last got to the table, and the
      Deacon was just closing his eyes preliminary to the blessing, when the
      stage horn blew.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bless me, Deacon, there's the stage ready," cried the Sawyer; "thank God
      for the sassengers, and let us fall too."
    </p>
    <p>
      I hardly need say the Deacon's blessing&mdash;and perhaps his breakfast
      were spoiled. But Sawyer had his "sassengers."

    <h2>
      Was'nt Murder After All.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When the present State House of Illinois, was being built&mdash;and it's a
      passable edifice, baring it is too low in the ground, and the <i>summer
      house</i> up on its top is too low to catch the cool breezes&mdash;it
      chanced that among the workmen engaged upon it was a New Yorker named
      Johnson. This man had a sovereign contempt for most of the shinplasters
      then circulating in Illinois; nor was he much amiss in this, for if it was
      now in existence, it would be exchangable at par with Jeff Davis'
      shinplasters. But through the instrumentality of Col. Thornton's
      negotiations in New York with McAlister of Stebbins, (a claim, by the way,
      that has never been settled but came near <i>settling</i> the State <i>a
      la</i> Mattoon,) a large amount of the bills of the New York <i>Metropolitan
      Bank</i> were put into circulation about Springfield. For this currency
      Johnson conceived so great a partiality that the passion of avarice soon
      turned it into a mania. He bought all these notes his means permitted, and
      stored them away about his person with miserly care.
    </p>
    <p>
      One Sunday Johnson was invited to ride out to the Cut off by a man (Smith
      for the nonce) and accepted. They did'nt stop at the Cut-off, but went
      direct to Sangamon River. Here, they were overheard quarrelling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smith came home without Johnson, who was soon missed, and as he was known
      to have gone away with Smith, that individual was soon put in that log
      building still standing (it did in '62) back of Carrigan's Hotel, and
      which has since served as a hen house etc. (Why don't Butler take a
      picture of it, to show the "rising generation" what a small house used to
      hold all the <i>known or taken</i> rogues of old Sangamon?)
    </p>
    <p>
      The examination of Smith, did not take place until the river bank had been
      examined. There were signs of a struggle on the bank, and to the water's
      edge, which gave force to the evidence of the man who heard them in
      dispute, and all felt convinced that Johnson had been murdered. Although a
      careful examination and dredging of the river failed to produce the body,
      Smith was committed for trial.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Abe was engaged as counsel for Johnson, but had little hopes of
      being of any earthly aid to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the day of trial came, and the prisoner plead "not guilty."
    </p>
    <p>
      I think it was Melborn who was the prosecuting Attorney; before the
      prosecution had opened the case Uncle Abe rose and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "May it please the Court, I have a motion to make before the prosecution
      opens; and as it may save the Court some unnecessary labor, I hope it will
      be entertained. <i>I move that the indictment be quashed and the prisoner
      discharged!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      The astonishment of the crowded Court room was immense, shared alike by
      Judge, bar and spectators. As soon as the Judge recovered his equanimity
      he asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon what grounds is so extraordinary a motion made?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why the man Johnson, was not murdered at all, and I have the pleasure of
      introducing <i>him to the presence of the Court</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnson was led forward. Hundreds recognized him immediately, The
      excitement was so great that the Judge adjourned the Court.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems that the parties had quarreled, Johnson had been pushed into the
      river, but had got out and wandered off in a state of partial aberation of
      mind and had been working on a farm. His passion for Metropolitan Bank
      Notes and his name suggested an idea that he was the missing man, and he
      was opportunely produced in time to save a man from being hung.

    <h2>
      Joe Reed's Mule Hunt.
    </h2>
    <p>
      One of the best natured fellows in the world, when he is not mad, is Joe
      Reed, of Logan County, Illinois, Joe is a staunch Republican&mdash;a real
      rip-rarer in the cause, and has given Uncle Abe the lift of a mighty broad
      pair of shoulders more than once, although at first he had a poor opinion
      of the rail-splitter. Thereby hangs a tale.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 18&mdash;, (the date is forgotten on account of the coldness of the
      weather that winter,) Joe lost a couple of mules. After they had been gone
      for a long time, he chanced to hear of them in a settlement somewhere
      within the present bounds of Macon County. Illinois. At the first
      opportunity Joe started on a mule hunt, determined to find either the
      mules or some <i>trace</i> of them. On reaching the neighborhood in
      question, Joe was satisfied that an old fellow named Bosby Sheel, had his
      mules; and when he went in person, and saw them, the assurance of his eyes
      made "assurance double sure." He at once made claim, but the old fellow
      had heard that possession was nine points of the law&mdash;he declined to
      surrender them; Joe immediately appealed to old Squire P&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
      who at once summoned the holder of the mules to his Court. The Squire
      informed Joe that he would have to prove property; but Joe said he would
      only have to swear to his property. In this dilemma, the Squire adjourned
      Court till after dinner and remarked to Joe that he had better get a
      lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is young Abe Lincoln, he don't live far from here, and he'll be at
      my house after dinner."
    </p>
    <p>
      As he was the only lawyer immediately thereabouts, Joe thought he had best
      employ him, in order to "have the law on his side."
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after dinner a stranger arrived, and the Justice (who was landlord of
      the only hotel in the settlement,) whispered to Joe, that that was the
      lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What!" exclaimed Joe, "that lean, lank gawky? Why, I'll bet both of them
      mules I know more law nor he does, for I'm a 'Squire at home myself&mdash;I
      am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But his looks is mighty deceivin', I tell you," said Boniface. "He's gin
      out to be one of the piertest young fellows short o' Sangamon."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Joe was decided, and the 'Squire re-convened his Court, he having the
      meantime laid the case before his young friend, the lawyer, and got his
      opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Acting his own lawyer, Joe felt it due to his course to give a concise
      statement of the law. As he stood up, he still continued to read from a
      green-covered book that had engaged his attention most of the day It was
      one of Cooper's latest novels. As Joe gave his version of the law, it
      seemed to 'Squire P&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; that he was <i>reading</i> the
      law.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that really the law?" said he, as Joe finished his version of the law&mdash;not
      the book. "Let me see that book."
    </p>
    <p>
      Joe mechanically handed it to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      After pouring over it for some time, he handed it back, with an air of
      disappointment, remarking:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Drat me! if I see any sich law in that book."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it ain't no wonder ye don't&mdash;that's the <i>Red Rover</i>, a
      novel and not a law book, and you've been and lost my place too," Joe
      found his place, and continued: "what I told you is what the law says, and
      I know it's so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, as you're a 'Squire, too, I reckon you ought to know. As the mules
      don't belong to old man Bosby Sheel and you swear they are you'rn, I hold
      he's bound to give'em up."
    </p>
    <p>
      Joe rallied the old Squire rather hard about looking over the <i>Red Rover</i>
      for extra law, but finally "give a treat" and left the Squire and his
      friend in the best of humors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Said Uncle Abe when he had the small-pox, "I now can give something to
      every one who calls."

      Judge Baldwin, an old and highly respectable and sedate gentleman, called
      a few days since on Gen. Halleck, and presuming upon a familiar
      acquaintance in California formerly, solicited a pass outside of our
      lines, to see a brother in Virginia, not thinking that he would be met
      with a refusal, as both his brother and himself were good Union men.

      "At a reception recently at the White House, many persons present noticed
      three little girls poorly dressed, the children of some mechanic or
      laboring man, who had followed the visitors into the house to gratify
      their curiosity. They were passed from room to room, and were passing
      through the reception room with some trepidation, when Uncle Abe, called
      to them: 'Little girls, are you going to pass me without shaking hands?'
      Then he bent his tall, awkward form down, and shook each little girl
      warmly by the hand. Everybody in the apartment was spellbound by the

      During the canvass between Uncle Abe, and Peter Cartright, the celebrated
      Pioneer Preacher, it chanced that Cartright, was returning to his home
      from the Williamsville and Wiggins Lane settlement. The nearest crossing
      of the Sangamon was at Carpenter's Mills, where there was the convenience
      of a ferry instead of a bridge, as is now the case. Upon the hill on the
      western side of the river, Cartright saw a man elevated upon a barrel in
      front of a little grocery&mdash;and on nearing him, he discovered that he
      was giving the Democrats in general, and Uncle Peter Cartright in
      particular, a perfect fusilade of small shots of slang and abuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I tell you, boys, I'm a Whig,&mdash;a real Harrison Tippacanoe and Tyler
      too, Whig," said he. "I'm for putting down all these cuss'd locofocos, and
      if we can't vote'em down, why I go for lickin'em' down. There's long Abe
      Lincoln that's runnin' for the Legislature&mdash;he's the chap to vote
      for. He's one of the people&mdash;split rails and got his edycation by
      moonlight. He don't go round the country prayin' and preachin' like that
      mean Methodist cuss, Peter Cartright, that's runnin' agin him. I'd like to
      know what we wants of a parson to make laws for us? Just elect him, and
      fust you know he'll have a bill into the Legislature, to fine us for not
      goin' to meetin' or for drinkin' a glass of whisky. I'll tell you what, if
      he ever comes round here, I'll just pass him inter the Sangamon&mdash;certain&mdash;sure."
    </p>
    <p>
      Just here Uncle Peter Cartright enquired for "the ferryman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm the ferry-man, old hoss," sung out the rustic orator, "and ken put ye
      cross the river in no time." Uncle Peter signified his desire to cross,
      and the twain started towards the ferry boat. The Preacher stepping into
      the boat, hitched his horse to the side, while the ferryman shoved out
      into the stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you are a Lincoln man?" queried Uncle Peter. "I'm that hoss."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so I presume you would douse a Cartright man if you had a chance?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mought do it stranger."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly you would douse Mr. Cartright?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure's winkin', old fellow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well Sir, I am Peter Cartright at your service," and before the ferryman
      recovered from his surprise Uncle Peter pitched him into the river, took
      the pole and put himself across the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ferryman did'nt vote for Uncle Peter but he altered his opinion of
      Methodist preachers in general and Uncle Peter in particular.

      One day as Uncle Abe, and a friend were sitting on the House of
      Representatives steps, the session closed, and the members filed out in a
      body. Uncle Abe looked after them with a serious smile. "That reminds me,"
      said he, "of a little incident when I was a boy; my flat boat lay up at
      Alton on the Mississippi, for a day, and I strolled about the town. I saw
      a large stone building, with massive stone walls, not so handsome though,
      as this, and while I was looking at it, the iron gateway opened, and a
      great body of men came out. 'What do you call that?' I asked a bystander.
      'That,' said he, 'is the State Prison, and those are all thieves going
      home. Their time is up.'"

    <p>
      Uncle Abe was terribly bored by the office seekers, even before the
      Presidential house-warming had scarcely began. The Illinois politicians
      were the most ravenous pap-Suckers of all.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just wait a little," said Uncle Abe, "I can assure you, as L&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;d
      S&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;t did the swine, 'there's enough for all.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us have the story, Uncle Abe," said one of the crowd, who evidently
      expected something rich.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, you see," began Uncle Abe, "I attended court many years ago at Mt.
      Pulaski, the first county seat of Logan County, and there was the jolliest
      set of rollicking young Lawyers there that you ever saw together. There
      was Bill F&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;n, Bill H&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;n, L&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;d
      S&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;t, and a lot more, and they mixed law and Latin,
      water and whisky, with equal success. It so fell out that the whisky
      seemed to be possessed of the very spirit of Jonah. At any rate, S&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;t
      went out to the hog-pen, and, leaning over, began to 'throw up Jonah.' The
      hogs evidently thought it feed time, for they rushed forward and began to
      squabble over the voided matter.

      Making a President.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Uncle Abe, in elucidating his estimate of Presidential honors, tells a
      clever story, as he always does, when he sets about it. It seems that
      Windy Billy, who is a politician of no ordinary pretensions, was a
      candidate for the Consulship of Bayonne, and he urged his appointment with
      the eloquence of a Clay or a Seward. He boasted vociferously of his
      activity in promoting the success of the Republican ticket, and averred
      with his impassioned earnestness that he and he alone had made Uncle Abe
      President.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" exclaimed Uncle Abe, "and it was you who made me President, was it?"
      a twinkle in his eye all the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Billy, rubbing his hands and throwing out his chest, as a
      baggage-master would a small valise, "yes, I think I may say I am the man
      who made you President."
    </p>
    <p>

      Uncle Peter Cartright's Wonder.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Some of the farmers in and about Saggamon county, Illinois, have been and
      still are so intent on cattle-raising, that the business is a sort of
      cattle-mania. Uncle Peter was one Sunday preaching near a good old deacon
      of this sort, whose piety was somewhat like that of a card-playing lady
      mentioned by Addison, (Spectator No. 7,) who had a set hour for her
      devotions, and if she happened to be at a game, would get a friend to
      "hold her hand" while she said her prayers. Our worthy deacon was rather
      vain of his "gift" praying and saying "blessings" at table. As a matter of
      courtesy, he might occasionally ask a visiting preacher to pray or ask a
      blessing; but he never failed to exhibit his "gift" to his visitors. He
      had a singsong way of "getting it off," at the same time beating time with
      his hands on either side of his plate. On the occasion alluded to, he
      began&mdash;"Oh Lord! (thump) bless the creature comforts (thump) provided
      for our (thump) sustenance (thump.) Bless it (thump) to our needs (thump)
      and necessities, (thump). Lead us aright, (thump) but if we stray (thump)
      put us back (thump) into the right path, (thump). Bless the stranger
      (thump) that comes beneath our roof, (thump) and keep his feet (thump) in
      pleasant paths, (thump). What we ask (thump) amiss, (thump) withhold;
      (thump) but grant us what our (thump) short-sightedness omits, (thump) and
      thine be the glory (thump) now and for ever, (thump) a&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;."
    </p>
    <p>
      And here the old deacon stopped suddenly, opened his eyes, and looking
      across the table, asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Son John, did Mr. Jones settle yet for that Durham cow?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, father&mdash;it's all right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Amen," concluded the deacon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cattle! cattle!" exclaimed Uncle Peter in ill-concealed disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, you can't say your prayers without having cattle running through
      your head; I wonder the Lord don't turn such Christians into cattle!"

    <p>
      In the Black Hawk war, Uncle Abe belonged to a militia company in the
      service. On a scout, the company encountered the Indians, and in a brisk
      skirmish drove them some miles, when, night coming on, our forces
      encamped. Great was the consternation on discovering that Lincoln was
      missing. His absence or rather his stories, from the bivouac, was a
      misfortune. Suddenly, however, he came into camp. "Maj. Abe, is that you?
      Thought you were killed. Where've you been?" were the startling
      speculations. "Yes," said Uncle Abe, "this is me&mdash;ain't killed
      either."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But where have you been all the time?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, just over there."

    <p>
      "But what were you over there for? Didn't run away, did you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said he deliberately, "I don't think I run away; but, after all, I
      reckon if anybody had seen me going, and had been told I was going for a
      doctor, he would have thought somebody was almighty sick."

      How to Get Rid of Rats.
    </h2>
    <p>
      So thick had the rats become in Logan County, a few years ago, that the
      means of getting rid of the nuisance was freely discussed. The newly
      organized Agricultural Society, finally concluded to offer three premiums
      for the then largest numbers. The man who took the largest prize,
      exhibited over 1,700 scalps all caught in the space of three weeks. At the
      time these prizes were pending, Uncle Abe attended Court there, and Col. L&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;n,
      (a considerable gourmand,) by the way, was discussing the best way to get
      rid of the rats, and finally asked Uncle Abe's opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why," said Uncle Abe, "rats are a 'cunning cattle,' and soon find out how
      things are going. I introduce them to your table as a delicacy, and when
      they find out you are making 'game' of them they will soon give you a wide
      berth."

      The Colonel winced under a faint impression; but silently ratified Uncle

      A Palpable Application
    </h2>
    <p>
      On a late occasion, when the White House was open to the public, a farmer
      from one of the border counties of Virginia told Uncle Abe that the Union
      soldiers, in passing his farm, had helped themselves not only to hay, but
      his horses, and he hoped the President would urge the proper officer to
      consider his claim immediately. "Why, my dear sir," replied Uncle Abe,
      blandly, "I couldn't think of such a thing. If I considered individual
      cases, I should find work for twenty Presidents!" Bowie urged his needs
      persistently; Uncle Abe declined good-naturedly. "But," said the
      persevering sufferer, "couldn't you just give me a line to Colonel &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-
      about it? just one line?" "Ha, ha, ha!" responded amiable Uncle Abe,
      shaking himself fervently, and crossing his legs the other way, "that
      reminds me of old Jack Chase out in Illinois." At this the crowd huddled
      forward to listen. "You have seen Jack&mdash;I knew him like a brother&mdash;used
      to be a lumberman on the Illinois, and he was steady and sober, and the
      best raftsman on the river. It was quite a trick twenty-five years ago to
      take the logs over the rapids, but he was skillful, with a raft, and
      always kept her straight in the channel. Finally a steamboat was put on,
      and Jack&mdash;he's dead now, poor fellow!&mdash;was made captain of her.
      He used to take the wheel going through the rapids. One day, when the boat
      was plunging and wallowing along the boiling current, and Jack's utmost
      vigilance was exercised to keep her in the narrow channel, a boy pulled
      his coat tail, and hailed him with, 'Sir, Mister Captain! I wish you'd
      just stop your boat a minute&mdash;I've lost my apple overboard!'"

      dispatches to you and others, saying that (General Steel,) must be master,
      but that it will probably be best for him to keep the convention on its
      own <i>plan</i>. Some single mind must be master, else there will be no
      agreement on any thing; and General Steel, commanding the military, and
      being on the ground, is the best man to be that master. Even now citizens
      are telegraphing me to postpone the election to a later day than either
      fixed by the Convention or me This discord must be silenced.

      A young Massachusetts soldier, named Merrill, writes a Washington
      correspondent, had on ounce ball pass through his head during the battle
      of Fredericksburg. It entered near his right eye and was extracted behind
      his left ear. Another ball would have entered a vital part of his body had
      it not been arrested by a Testament, in which it lodged. When this
      safeguard was shown to Uncle Abe, he sent to the hospital a handsome
      pocket Bible, in which was written: "Charles V. Merrill, Co. A. 19th
      Massachusetts, from A. Lincoln."

    <p>
      To a man who was condoling Uncle Abe on the disaster at Olustee, and

    </p>
    <p>
      "Your remarks are well intended, doubtless; but they do little less than
      aggravate a thing which I can't help thinking might have been helped. It
      reminds me of a story that I read when I was a boy. An old fellow who had
      clambered rather high into an apple tree, fell and broke his arm. A
      sympathizing and philosophic neighbor, seeing his mishap, went to his aid.
      'Ah,' said he, 'if you had followed my plan you would have escaped this.'
      'Indeed, what is your plan?' enquired the groaning man. 'Why, never to let
      go both hands, till you get one hold somewhere else.'"

      "Linkums" Sold Cheap.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daring the Presidential contest of 1860, there was an Italian artist of
      plaster figures in Springfield, who supplied "leetel Linkums," as he
      called his figures, faster than ever Uncle Abe did. He succeeded in
      putting one of these Republican penates into every Republican house in
      town, but they finally became a "drug" in the market. However, he kept his
      "asking price" up; but his selling price was as various as his buyers, and
      hard to deal with.

      expecting to pose the Italian.

    <p>
      "You takes'em," greedily exclaimed the artist, and he left Mr. L. A. A&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;n

    <h2>
      Uncle Abe as a Pilot.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The captain of one of the Mississippi river steamers one morning, while
      his boat was lying at her moorings at New Orleans, waiting for the tardy
      pilot, who, it appears, was a rather uncertain sort of fellow, saw a tall,
      gaunt Sucker make his appearance before the captain's office, and sing out&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hello, cap'n! you don't want a pilot nor nothin' about this 'ere craft,
      do ye?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you know I don't?" responded the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you don't understand; I axed you s'posin' you did?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, supposing I do, what of it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Uncle Abe, for it was he, "I reckon I know suthin' about that
      ere sort o' business, provided you wanted a feller of jest about my size."
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain gave him a scrutinising glance, and with an expression of
      countenance which seemed to say, "I should pity the steamer that you
      piloted," asked&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you acquainted with the river, and do you know where the snags are?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, ye-as," responded Uncle Abe rather hesitatingly, "I'm pretty well
      acquainted with the river, but the snags, I don't know exactly so much
      about them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't know about the snags?" exclaimed the captain, contemptuously,
      "don't know about the snags! You'd make a pretty pilot!"
    </p>
    <p>
      At this Uncle Abe's countenance assumed anything but an angelic
      expression, and with a darkened brow and a fiercely flashing eye, he drew
      himself up to his full height, and indignantly roared back in a voice of
      thunder:
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do I want to know where the snags are for, old sea-hoss? I know
      where they ain't, and there's where I do my sailing!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It is sufficient to know that Uncle Abe was promptly engaged, and that the
      captain takes pleasure in saying that he proved himself one of the best
      pilots on the river.

    <h2>
      Uncle Abe's Valentine.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Uncle Abe on the 14th of last February, received a valentine in the shape
      of a picture of the American eagle, with a financial allusion. The bird of
      freedom appeared to be engaged in picking up gold coin, while at the end
      of the bird most remote from his head there was a pile of "green-backs,"
      into which this coin seemed to have been mysteriously transmuted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Abe, who takes such things philosophically, and always acknowledges
      a palpable hit with grace and good natured cheerfulness, went to his
      Secretary of the Treasury, to exhibit his bird, in order that the latter
      might enjoy the joke with him. Mr. Chase, however, was not disposed to
      take the matter in the same spirit Uncle Abe did; but appeared to be much
      out of humor at this hieroglyphical attack upon his department of the
      government. In tones in which there was evidently a slight admixture of
      irritability, he remarked to Uncle Abe that he would like to know who had
      made this unwarrantable attack upon his financial management of the
      affairs of the nation&mdash;that he feared that some of his subordinates
      had got up this libel upon him, and that he would give a hundred dollars
      to know who had done it. Uncle Abe? whose question-asking proclivities are
      well known, said that the offer seemed liberal; "but, Mr. Chase," said he,
      "before I shall make up my mind on this subject, will you allow me to ask
      you one question?" "Certainly," replied the Secretary. "I merely wanted to
      understand," said Uncle Abe, "at which end of the bird you propose to
      pay?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Et tu Brute?'" responded the head of the Treasury department. "If I am
      thus to be made the subject of ridicule, I must renew my application to be
      relieved from my duties as Secretary."
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, never mind! never mind! Mr. Secretary," said Uncle Abe, "we can soon
      remedy all these difficulties. All we have to do, after we have suppressed
      this rebellion, is to turn the bird end for end, and let the gold and
      'greenbacks' remain just as they are and all will come out right." The
      Secretary, restored to good humor, agreed not to resign unless Seward did.

    </h2>
    <p>
      Many months ago the post commander at Cairo was a certain West Point
      colonel of a Northwestern regiment, noted for his soldierly qualities and
      rigid discipline. One day he passed by the barracks and heard a group of
      soldiers singing the well-known street piece, "My Mary Ann." An angry
      shade crossed his brow, and he forthwith ordered the men to be placed in
      the guard-house, where they remained all night The next morning he visited
      them, when one ventured to ask the cause of their confinement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cause enough," said the rigid colonel; "you were singing a song in
      derision of Mrs. Colonel B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;."
    </p>
    <p>
      The men replied by roars of laughter, and it was some time before the
      choler of the Colonel could be sufficiently subdued to understand that the
      song was an old one, and sung by half the school-boys in the land, or the
      risibles of the men be calmed down to learn that the colonel's wife
      rejoiced in the name of "Mary Ann."

    <p>
      At one time Uncle Abe aspired to a position on the bench, and Mrs.
      Lincoln, so as to be prepared for the event, practiced the habit of
      calling her husband "his Honor," or "your Honor," as the case might be.
      Uncle Abe never, however, succeeded to the dignity of the ermine; but
      attending Circuit at Chicago, and stopping at the &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      Hotel, Mrs. L. accompanied her husband, as was her custom. Uncle Abe had
      donned a bran new pair of boots, which were anything but comfortable, and
      almost as uncertain as a pair of skates to a learner on the keenest of
      ice. Mrs. Lincoln was enjoying herself in the parlor in a chit-chat with a
      number of other ladies, and putting on as many airs as her provincial
      position in Springfield would admit, when a strange, rumbling sound
      disturbed the pleasant company, who rushed out to learn what was the
      matter. Lo and behold! there was Uncle Abe in the undignified predicament
      of tumbling down stairs and bumping the end of his spine upon every step.
      The new boots, or the swig of forty-rod which he had taken in his
      bed-room, had proved traitor to him. Mrs. Lincoln was nearly non-plussed,
      but exclaimed in a consoling voice, "Is your Honor hurt?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Uncle Abe, sitting gracefully on the carpet, with legs spread
      out amidst the bevy of tittering damsels, and rubbing the seat of his
      trowsers, "No, my honor is not hurt but my&mdash;my&mdash;my head is!"

      "Smoke That."
    </h2>
    <p>
      During the session of the Legislature of Illinois, in 1836-7, the Sangamon
      County delegation of nine members, became known as the "Long Nine," from
      the fact of their remarkable average height. In this delegation were Uncle
      Abe, Gen. Baker, (killed at Bull's Bluff,) N. W. Edwards, (brother-in-law
      of Uncle Abe, and now Captain commissary,) and some others of note in
      their day. A law had passed the previous session to remove the capital
      from Vandalia to Springfield, to be carried out as soon as a new capitol
      could be built. In the meantime, Gen. W. L. D. Ewing, an influential
      Egyptian member, made periodical efforts to repeal the law and keep the
      capital at Vandalia. During the session of 1837, we had a regular tilt
      with the "long nine," during which, whenever Uncle Abe or Gen. Baker made
      a point, Ewing would be saluted with the cry "smoke that!" in allusion to
      "long nines," a popular kind of cigars used at that day. This probably
      gave rise to saying, "put that in your pipe and smoke it."

      Chase go. I am situated very much as the boy was who held the bear by the
      hind legs. I will tell you how it was. There was a very vicious bear
      which, after being some time chased by a couple of boys, turned upon his
      pursuers. The boldest of the two ran up and caught the bear by the hind
      legs, while the other climbed up into a little tree, and complacently
      witnessed the conflict going on beneath, between the bear and his
      companion. The tussel was a sharp one, and the boy, after becoming quite
      exhausted, cried out in alarm, 'Bill, for God's sake come down and help me
      let this darned bear go!' Now, gentlemen," said Mr. Lincoln, "you see what

      Uncle Abe's First Speech.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Uncle Abe first made his appearance in the Illinois House of
      Representatives, and was desirous of delivering his sentiments on a
      certain measure, he rose and began:&mdash;"Mr. Speaker, <i>I conceive</i>&mdash;&mdash;"
      but could go no further. Thrice he repeated unsuccessfully the same
      attempt; when Douglas, who had more confidence, and had been a year longer
      in the House, completely dumbfounded Abe by saying: "Mr. Speaker, The
      honorable gentleman has <i>conceived three times, and brought forth
      nothing.</i>"

      One night Uncle Abe came wet and cold to a cross road tavern in Indiana,
      and found the fire more thoroughly blockaded with Hoosiers than mother
      Welles has been able to blockade the Southern Confederacy. Abe ordered the
      landlord to carry his horse a peck of catfish. "He can't eat catfish,"
      said Boniface. "Try him," said Abe, "there's nothing like trying." The
      crowd all rushed after the landlord to see Abe's horse eat the peck of
      catfish. "He won't eat them, as I told you," said the landlord, on
      returning. "Then," coolly responded Uncle Abe, who had squatted on the
      best seat, "bring them to me and I'll eat them myself."

      territory and stopping the fighting. The North took the Northern States,
      and the South the Gulf and seaboard Southern States. Lincoln took Texas
      and Missouri, and Davis Kentucky and Tennessee; so that all were parcelled
      off excepting Arkansas. Lincoln did'nt want it&mdash;Jeff, would'nt have

      Nigger Mathematics.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Uncle Abe was lately visited by one of the "On to Richmond" sword of
      Gideon gentry, who confidently expressed the hope, so common among the
      Abolition noodles, that Lee's army would be "bagged." Uncle Abe grinned to
      the utmost of his classic mouth, and remarked that he was afraid there
      would be too much "nigger mathematics" in it. The visitor smiled at the
      allusion, as he felt bound in politeness to do supposing there must be
      something in it, though he could not see the point. "But I suppose you
      don't know what 'nigger mathematics' is," continued Uncle Abe. "Lay down
      your hat a minute, and I'll tell you." He, himself, resumed the sitting
      posture leaned back in his chair, elevated his heels on the table, and
      went on with his story. "There was a darkey in my neighborhood, called
      Pompey, who, from a certain quickness in figuring up the prices of
      chickens and vegetables, got the reputation of being a mathematical
      genius. Johnson, a darkey preacher, heard of Pompey, and called to see
      him. 'Here ye're a great mat'm'tishum, Pompey.' 'Yes sar, you jas try.'
      'Well Pompey, Ize compound a problem in mat'matics.' 'All right, sar.'
      'Now, Pompey, spose dere am tree pigeons sittin' on a rail fence, and you
      fire a gun at'em and shoot one, how many's left?' 'Two, ob cooors,'
      replies Pompey after a little wool scratching. 'Ya-ya-ya,' laughs Mr.
      Johnson; 'I knowed you was a fool, Pompey; dere's <i>none</i> left&mdash;one's
      dead, and d'udder two's flown away.' "That's what makes me say," continued
      Uncle Abe, "that I am afraid there was too much nigger mathematics in the
      Pennsylvania campaign." And the result showed that in this instance, at
      least, the anecdote suited the fact. Lee's army was then three pigeons.
      One of them was taken down at Gettysburg, but the other two flew off over
      the Potomac.

      A Story that had no Reminder.
    </h2>
    <p>
      During a conversation which took place between Uncle Abe and a
      distinguished western senator, the recent legislative nominations for the
      next presidency were incidentally referred to. "Yes," said Uncle Abe,
      nursing his leg with evident gratification&mdash;"yes senator, the current
      seems to be setting all one way!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It does, really, seem to be setting all one way," was the answer of the
      senator; "but, Mr. Lincoln, as you have told me several good stories since
      I have been here, permit me if you please, to tell <i>you</i> one. It has
      always been observed that the Atlantic Ocean, at the Straits of Gibraltar,
      constantly pours into the Mediterranean with tremendous volume. The
      Bosphorus empties into it, at its other end, and rivers are seen
      contributing to its waters all along its coast. It was for many years the
      constant puzzle of geographers, why the Mediterranean, under all these
      accessions, never got full, and overran its banks. After a while, however,
      a curious fellow took the notion of dropping a plummet in the center of
      the Straits, when, lo! he discovered that, though the tremendous body of
      water on the surface was rushing inward from the ocean, a still more
      powerful body was passing outward, in a counter current, some twenty feet
      below!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, ah!" said Uncle Abe, seriously, evidently nonplussed, for the first
      time in his life; "that <i>does not</i> remind me of any story I ever
      heard before!"

    <h2>
      Has it "Gin Out?"
    </h2>
    <p>
      We do not know what joke Uncle Abe made when he heard the news of the
      surrender of Plymouth. In regard to the Fort Pillow affair he made a
      Bunsby speech, but no joke. His last joke, of which we have any knowledge,
      occurred when Secretary Chase was starting on his trip to New York. Uncle
      Abe is like Cromwell without his military genius, and is very fond of
      playing practical jokes on his associates. It is said that after Cromwell
      had signed the warrant for the execution of King Charles he turned round
      to one of his colleagues and smeared his face with the ink. This he
      thought capital fun. Uncle Abe's jokes are of about the same quality. When
      Chase called upon him to say good bye, the Secretary of the Treasury asked
      for some information about the probable end of the war, saying it would
      help him greatly in getting more money in Wall street. "Do you want more
      money?" asked Lincoln, and then quickly added, "What! has the printing
      machine gin out?" This joke is fully equal to Cromwell's.

      mentioning a circumstance or two connected with the Major's history.
      Finally Uncle Abe remembered him very well&mdash;which fact he stated in

      turkey egg faced fellow that you'd think did'nt know as much as a last

      Uncle Abe goes into Partnership.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the days when Uncle Abe plied the flat-boat business on the Wabash and
      Sangamon, he made it a practice to troll for catfish and dispose of them
      to the planters in Mississippi, when passing their plantations. This
      brought him quite a revenue, which was always expended for "forty rod"
      whisky, or the fish were traded off direct for that fluid chain lightning.
      Once while passing the plantation of Mr. Percy, he was bound to have some
      forty rod, and went ashore with a fine lot of fish. A large party were
      assembled at the mansion of the aristocratic Percy; when Julius C�sar
      informed him that Uncle Abe was below with some very fine fish. "Well,"
      said Percy, "give him his forty rod as usual, and let him go."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But sah, he won't take it dis time," said the darkey, "he wants a hundred
      lashes on the bare back, well laid on massa." Uncle Abe insisted to the
      surprise of every one on this strange price for his fish, and Mr. Percy to
      humor him, complied, directing the overseer to cut him gently. When Uncle
      Abe had received the fiftieth lash, he cried, "Hold! I have got a partner
      in this business, to whom I have engaged to give half of whatever I should
      get for the fish&mdash;this overseer would not admit me only on that
      condition." O course the overseer had his share well paid, and Abe got his
      forty-rod as usual, with something added.

      The Wrong Man Poulticed.

    <p>
      At the famous watering place, of the Blue Lick Springs, Uncle Abe was
      severely afflicted with a pain in the stomach, which neither gin
      cock-tails nor other cordials could remove. It was night and he was in
      bed. His loving wife, unwilling to awake the domestics, descended to the
      kitchen, and prepared mustard poultice, which she spread on her own
      handkerchief, and proceeded with it to the distressed Uncle Abe. Before
      leaving him, she left a light dimly burning in the apartment; but deeply
      impressed with anxiety, she was not as careful as she might have been in
      noting the number of her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Guided by a light which she saw shining in a chamber, and which she
      supposed was the one she had left, she entered, and gently raising the bed
      clothes, &amp;c., laid the warm poultice upon a stomach but not the
      stomach of Uncle Abe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hello there! What the &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; are you about?"
      shouted a voice of thunder, and the body and sleeves? whence it issued,
      sprang out of bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady screamed and ran; Uncle Abe rushed to the rescue from the next
      room, the waiters joined and a small scene ensued, much to the amusement
      of all concerned. The poulticed gentleman had indiscreetly left a light in
      his room, and this lured the lady from her path.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Abe was so amused and excited by the mistake that he quite forgot
      his pains; but early the next morning, with his wife and trunks, left for
      Springfield, 111. The poulticed man still retains the handkerchief&mdash;a
      beautiful cambric&mdash;with the lady's name on it, the initials of
      Frances Amelia E. Todd.

      Uncle Abe as School Superintendent.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Uncle Abe kept grocery on the Sangamon he was elected as School
      Superintendent out of his district. It was his duty to examine the
      applicant teachers on mathematics; which he once did in this wise in his
      grocery store. "If two pigs weigh twenty pounds how much will a large hog
      weigh."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jump into the scales," said the weilder of the birch, "and I'll soon tell
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Abe did not examine him further in mathematics.

      Take Away the Fowls.
    </h2>
    <p>
      After Uncle Abe had studied law some time and whilst travelling in the
      Prairie country in Knox County, Illinois, he stopped at the house of Mrs.
      Galt, an old Scotch lady whose husband was largely engaged in wool
      growing. Abe at this time was beginning to be proud of his learning,
      especially of his pronunciation of English. Mrs. Galt when dinner was over
      desired the servant in waiting to take away the fowls, which she, (as is
      sometimes done in Scotland), pronounced <i>fools</i>, "I presume, madam,
      you mean fowls" said Abe rather sententiously. "Very well, be it so," said
      Mrs. Galt; "take away the <i>fowls</i>, but let the <i>fool</i> remain!"

    <h2>
      Hit at Antietam.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Another story of Uncle Abe, too good to be lost, has leaked out. It seems
      he had accompanied a young lady to one of the hospitals in the capitol
      where the sympathizing creature, as in duty bound became interested in a
      wounded soldier. To all her inquiries as to the location of the wound,
      however, she could only get one reply, thus: "My good fellow where were
      you hit!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "At Antietam."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but where did the bullet strike you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "At Antietam."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But where did it hit you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "At Antietam." Becoming discouraged, she deputized Uncle Abe to prosecute
      the inquiry, which he did successfully Upon his rejoining her, she was
      more curious than, ever, when the President, taking both her hands in his
      said in his most impressive style. "My dear girl, the ball that hit <i>him</i>,
      would not have injured <i>you</i>."

      remind me now of a piece of meadow land on the Sangamon bottoms during a
      drouth."

      observed: "Mr. President, I have never yet been enabled to discover the
      utility of constructing and maintaining those forts. What is your opinion
      about them?"

      "Well doctor," replied Uncle Abe, "you are a medical man! and I will ask

      A client of Uncle Abe's was tried for stealing, in Springfield, Illinois,

      to. The judge charged against the prisoner, but to his astonishment the
      jury brought in a verdict that the accused was entirely unworthy of

      When Uncle Abe joined the Sangamon Militia and entered on the Black Hawk

      attracted by his awkward appearance, the dapper little Colonel thus
